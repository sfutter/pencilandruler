  <div class="col-md-3"><h4>PENCIL</h4><p>Pencil currently works as an Art Director at Titan, and outdoor advertising company. Pencil also works as a freelance graphic designer under the pseudonym “WN Design”. </br></br>In his free time, Pencil likes to play footy (soccer to the common American), rock out with his guitar named “Dusty” and paint random things.</p></div>
  <div class="col-md-3"><h4>RULER</h4><p>Ruler currently works for a large media company as an Senior Analyst, but his true passion lies in complicated, nerdy stuff we humans call “programming”. Ruler loves programming so  much he even teaches classes. </br></br>In his free time, Ruler is...programming! Honestly, what else is there?</p></div>
  <div class="col-md-4"><h4>OUR POWERS COMBINED</h4><p>Pencil + Ruler are two dudes, one a graphic designer (Pencil) and the other a genius programmer (Ruler), who just want to make your stuff look good. </br></br>We know there are all sorts of “create your own website” services out there and websites to make websites, but if you’re looking for a personal, tailored experience then give us a holler. We work closely with our clients to craft a website from scratch to make sure it’s as much a reflection of you as your favorite pair of socks (the polka dot ones—they’re pretty sweet).</p></div>
